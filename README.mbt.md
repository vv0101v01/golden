# cubical-hermitian

A governed **Five-Federation Architecture & Grand Unification** MoonBit platform
for structural algorithms, geometry, and logic (`5 federations + unification apex`,
`27 packages`, `36 components`):

1. **Federation 1 — `cubical`: Cubical paths, univalence and exact spectra**
   (the root package, `algebra/`, and `cmd/main`):
   a dependent cubical kernel, Kan operations, computational univalence,
   exact BigInt algebra and Hermitian spectral certificates.
2. **Federation 2 — `symlib`: Finite symmetry and categorical Kan extensions**
   (`symlib/`, `cmd/symdemo`, `cmd/symbench`): graph canonical forms, automorphism
   groups, finite categories, presheaves, G-sets and executable certificates.
3. **Federation 3 — `semiring`: Semiring path algebra and tropical geometry**
   (`semiring/*`, `cmd/semiringreport`): semiring traits, generic
   dense/CSR matrices and star closure, weighted directed graphs, tropical
   geometry, regular-language and idempotent-semiring normal forms, factor
   graphs and measured performance infrastructure.
4. **Federation 4 — `topos`: Grothendieck & elementary toposes** (`topos/`): sites, sieves,
   two-step Plus sheafification, Cartesian closedness, subobject classifiers,
   Lawvere–Tierney & co-Heyting open/closed subtopos nuclei (`J_o(U) ∧ J_c(U) = J_triv`,
   `J_o(U) ∨ J_c(U) = J_⊥`), geometric & essential morphisms (`Lan_{u^{op}} ⊣ u* ⊣ Ran_{u^{op}}`
   via `@sym.lan` and `@sym.ran`), Grothendieck–Verdier dense subsite Comparison
   Lemma, Diaconescu points & internal `G`-torsor sheaves (`T × G ≅ T × T`),
   local/connected/atomic/compact-coherent invariants, Kripke–Joyal semantics,
   Joyal–Reyes geometric normal forms, classifying toposes,
   category-of-elements categorification, groupoid stacks, general non-abelian
   `G`-torsor Čech 1-cohomology (`H^1(U, G)`), Roos/Čech sheaf cohomology,
   Alexander–Whitney simplicial cup-product DG-algebras (`H^1 ⌣ H^1 -> H^2`,
   separating `T^2` from `S^1 ∨ S^1 ∨ S^2`) and order-independent simplicial
   nerve homotopy types (`∂Δ^d` spheres, `RP^2`, `T^2`).
5. **Federation 5 — `scheme`: Algebraic schemes and motives** (`scheme/`): Buchberger reduced Gröbner
   bases, elimination/saturation/radical ideals, Zariski partition-of-unity
   gluing, reduced schemes (`X_red ↪ X`), Kähler differentials (`Ω^1_{B/A}`),
   general `i`-th Fitting ideals (`Fitt_i(M)`) & Eisenbud Theorem 20.8 pure-dimensional
   smoothness (rejecting mixed-dimension schemes alongside singularities),
   Tjurina singularity numbers (`τ = 0, 1, 2, 3`), unramified/smooth/étale morphism
   criteria, general `n`-dimensional projective gluing (`P^n`, projective subschemes,
   `A^n`, `A^2 \ {0}`, doubled-origin line) and morphisms, affine morphisms,
   diagonal separatedness, `Q[[t]] ⊂ Q((t))` DVR valuative properness,
   Macaulay–Taylor symbolic Hilbert polynomials `P_X(t) ∈ Q[t]` (degree & arithmetic
   genus in arbitrary codimension, including the twisted cubic in `P^3`), Rees blow-up
   `Bl_{(0,0)}(A^2)` curve desingularization, rational equivalence (`CH^1`, Bézout),
   Grothendieck–Serre dualizing complexes (`ω_{P^1} = O(-2)[1]`, `ω_{P^2} = O(-3)[2]`,
   and plane-curve `ω_C = O_C(d-3)[1]`), functor of points (`h_X(R)` including
   `F_p[ε]` tangents and `F_3 ⊂ F_9` Galois–Frobenius descent) and 6-variable
   multi-projective Gröbner Chow correspondences (`h(P^1) ≅ 1 ⊕ L`).
6. **Unification Apex — `unification`: Complete `K_5` cross-federation bridges &
   geometry-logic correspondence** (`bridge/`, `cmd/showcase`):
   all $\binom{5}{2} = 10$ pairwise cross-federation bridges (`K5-01` .. `K5-10`),
   the Five-Federation Pentagon Quadratic Galois–Étale Double-Cover Unification
   Theorem, cross-pillar logical theory translations, the 18-entry Fine-Grained
   Geometry–Logic Correspondence Atlas (`ATLAS-01` .. `ATLAS-18`), and the
   `S^1` / `P^1` / `P^2` / Galois / motivic synthesis.

Cross-federation constructions live only in `bridge/`; no federation may import
`bridge/`, and `tools/arch_check.py` enforces strict inter-federation import
allowlists.  See the [migration guide](docs/MIGRATION.md), the
[finite-symmetry document](docs/symlib.md), the
[semiring documents](docs/semiring/README.md), and the
[bridge guide](docs/BRIDGE.md).

## Verified federation snapshot

The governed manifest (`architecture.json` v2) partitions **5 federations +
1 unification apex, 27 packages, 36 components** (`191` `.mbt` files,
`135,148` `.mbt` lines), and the generated bilingual appendices classify
**6,484 public symbols** across `SPEC-APPENDIX.md` and
`SPEC-APPENDIX.en.md` (`spec_registry`: **127** entries).  Fast local gates:
`moon check --deny-warn --target wasm-gc`,
`moon test --release --target wasm-gc` (**15/15** consolidated `L8` tests across all federations),
`moon run --release cmd/main --target wasm-gc` (**124/124** theorems),
`moon run --release cmd/showcase --target wasm-gc` (**5/5 federations, 10/10 `K_5` pairwise bridges,
42/42 grand-unification certificates**, including Phase-15 and Phase-16 cubical/algebraic certificates and all **18/18** Geometry–Logic
Atlas entries), `python3 tools/arch_check.py`, and
`moon info && python3 tools/audit_spec.py --check`.  The native
semiring report (`moon run cmd/semiringreport --target native`) is a
separate slow gate, not part of the fast gate.

Pi/Sigma with a cumulative universe hierarchy); persistent shared
environments, call-by-need semantic thunks and memoized dimension lines /
type families; a cubical AST with PathP, data types (Bool/Nat/List),

semantic lemIso construction for contractible fibers and automatic
adjointification; internal IntegerS and pi3 quotient presentations with a
